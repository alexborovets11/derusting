# Items to Refresh on:

As you work through this exercise, write down anything that you needed to look up or struggled to remember here. It can be just a word or two (e.g. "joining strings"). You can use this as a guide of what to make extra sure you're refreshed on before exams and interviews.

- String Practice
- Set Practice
- List Practice
- Overall, I do need to look over all of these a little more to get them down
- Because I am a little shaky on them.
